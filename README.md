# Hexcessible

Hex Casting, with a bit more accessibility sprinkled on top.

Hexcessible lets you be rest assured you drew the correct pattern, or you can ask for help with Magic Autocomplete, which you can alias the names of, if you'd like. It also lets you cast with the keyboard. All major Hex Casting addons are supported out of the box.

**Hexcessible is customizable. Be sure to check the config menu in the game!**
